module CurrentCart

  # Note that we place the set_cart() method in a CurrentCart module and place that module in a new
  # file in the app/controllers/concerns directory. This treatment allows us to *share* common code
  # (even as little as a single method!) among controllers.

  # We mark the method as private, which prevents Rails from ever making it available as an action
  # on the controller.
  private

  # The set_cart() method starts by getting the :cart_id from the session object and then attempts to
  # find a cart corresponding to this ID. If such a cart record isnâ€™t found (which will happen if the
  # ID is nil or invalid for any reason), this method will proceed to create a new Cart and then store
  # the ID of the created cart into the session.

  def set_cart
    @cart = Cart.find(session[:cart_id])
  rescue ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound
    @cart = Cart.create
    session[:cart_id] = @cart.id
  end
